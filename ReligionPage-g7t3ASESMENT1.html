      <!judasim and abraham>
      <p>Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all a type of religion called:
        "monothestic religons"
        these type of religons believe in only <b>1</b> god.</p>
      
      <p>abraham was a very important person. he wished to have many kids, and got his wish granted by god.</p>
      <p>but abraham did not get this instantly. he made a <span style="background-color:yellow"><u>Covenant</u></span>. so what is a Covernant?</p>
      <p>a Covernant is a <b>promise</b>. in this case: a promise made between <i>god</i> and <i>abraham</i>. this promise was that abraham would have many children. but in return he must call god. well god.</p>
      <p>he also must change his name from <b>abram</b> to <b>abraham</b> and circumsise him and his children</p>
      <p>abraham had a child with sarah (issac) and a child with the maid hagar (ishmael)</p>
      <p>issac was turned to judism and ishmael was turned to islam</p>

      <!moses>
      <p>moses is another important person. why? because he was the one who had saved the slaves of egypt.</p>
      <p>moses is actually a part of judaism.</p>
      <p>the 10 palques would kill all the children but if moses marked their doors with blood. they would be saved.</p>
      <p>the 10 commandments were given to moses to then tell the people of them.</p>
      <p>the 10 commandments are a list of many rules you shall not do. <i>"you shall not murder" / "you shall not steal"</i></p>
